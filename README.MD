# Spring API Gateway with Rate Limiting

This project is a Spring-based API Gateway built using Spring Cloud Gateway. It routes HTTP traffic to various microservices and includes a built-in rate limiting filter to help protect your backend services from excessive traffic. In our project, the gateway routes requests to multiple services a user management service on `localhost:9100`) and  tenant management service on `localhost:9110`)  applies rate limiting based on configurable limits.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice (e.g., user management, tenant management).
- **Rate Limiting:** Uses Spring Cloud Gatewayâ€™s built-in rate limiting filter (Redis-based or in-memory) to throttle requests.
- **OAuth2 Integration:** Routes OAuth2 callbacks (from GitHub) to the appropriate user management service.
- **Centralized API Gateway:** Acts as the single entry point for your microservices architecture.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17+** (Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly)
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **Redis:** (Ensure Redis cache is running on your local machine)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/4thworldsoldier/babbangona-api-gateway.git
  
2. **Build and Run the project:**
   open project using any IDE or Text editor that supports java 
   Build and run the project directly on the IDE/editor  --or
   Build the project to generating a .jar artifact
   Run using java -jar <artifactname>


## Configuration
   to configure the service navigate to src/main/resource/application.yml
   to set forwarding routes use the routes tag
   to set the rate limit use the filters tag

## Routing Rules
   each request recieved is forwarded to the predicate configured 


## Rate Limiting
   Request from a client ip has been capped to 5 request per second 
   However this can be easily configured in the yaml file
